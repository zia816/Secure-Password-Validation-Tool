# Secure-Password-Validation-Tool
This project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for securely validating passwords using the bcrypt hashing algorithm. Users can input their password into the entry field and click the "validate" button. The entered password is then hashed and compared to a pre-existing hash for validation.
